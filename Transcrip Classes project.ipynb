In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling.

      "[04:26.120 --> 04:26.260]  it.\n",
      "[04:26.360 --> 04:30.260]  And therefore, you can have some sort of a prediction of a failure, and therefore, you\n",

      "[05:01.320 --> 05:07.160]  All right, so in other words, these are the business talks that we need to discuss because\n",
      "[05:07.160 --> 05:15.520]  eventually, you know, we start from the business talks and then obviously we deviate to develop\n",
      "[05:15.520 --> 05:16.320]  these systems.\n",
      "[05:18.380 --> 05:21.540]  I lost the slides for a second, just a moment.\n",

      "[05:28.860 --> 05:30.100]  So there you go. Okay.\n",
      "[05:33.800 --> 05:34.560]  Share again.\n",
      "[05:37.260 --> 05:39.840]  There you go. Okay, so now you should be able to see them. Very good.\n",
      "[05:41.660 --> 05:42.420]  Okay, so...\n",
      "[05:42.420 --> 05:48.740]  All right, so this was the first use case. Well, the second use case would be quality inspection and assurance. Well,\n",
      "[05:58.080 --> 05:58.840]  they usually...\n",
      "[05:58.840 --> 06:04.100]  category at almost 21%. So while there are various ways to do AI based quality inspection,\n",
      "[06:05.000 --> 06:12.980]  automated optical inspection is by far the largest subcategory. So cost implications of this are\n",
      "[06:12.980 --> 06:19.120]  after implementing optical expansion on the plants. Bosch, the company Bosch that you know,\n",
      "[06:19.120 --> 06:29.000]  has claimed to achieve to have achieved more than 1.5 million euro savings due\n",
      "[06:29.000 --> 06:34.180]  to 45% of the total test time reduction. So in other words this type of\n",
      "[06:34.180 --> 06:43.480]  estimates can lead to a great amount of savings right. So the other one let's\n",
      "[06:43.480 --> 06:47.420]  say talk about the automated data management let's say automated data\n",
      "[06:47.420 --> 06:54.320]  management when data often stores in multiple systems and in multiple places, it is hard\n",

      "[06:58.180 --> 07:04.940]  Therefore, some industry companies start to employ data management solutions that perform\n",
      "[07:04.940 --> 07:12.040]  such tasks as data acquisitions, data filtering, data cleaning, integration, etc., right?\n",
      "[07:12.740 --> 07:15.720]  Voice assistance, smart assistance, for example.\n",
      "[07:15.720 --> 07:20.220]  I'm just keeping several of these, but I just wanted to kind of give you the concept.\n",

      "[07:28.080 --> 07:34.020]  integrating voice assistant technology into its real-time industrial monitoring systems,\n",
      "[07:34.740 --> 07:40.020]  allows workers to do what to gain insights without coding, the explicit commands,\n",
      "[07:40.020 --> 07:43.940]  or printing long status reports.\n",
      "[07:45.440 --> 07:47.760]  And then of course autonomous resources,\n",

      "[07:52.000 --> 07:55.780]  querying and let's say some oil and gas\n",

      "[08:10.000 --> 08:12.600]  of data and images in more dangerous areas\n",
      "[08:12.600 --> 08:13.600]  where humans are not allowed.\n",
      "[08:15.800 --> 08:17.780]  And of course, they can detect the optimal point\n",
      "[08:17.780 --> 08:21.100]  for specific resource extraction, et cetera,\n",
      "[08:21.100 --> 08:23.400]  this way by remote using remote machines.\n",
      "[08:23.640 --> 08:28.540]  And AI can be especially useful in detection of activities\n",
      "[08:29.400 --> 08:35.340]  in difficult to access areas such as the ocean surface\n",
      "[08:35.340 --> 08:37.280]  or mountains, right?\n",
      "[08:39.180 --> 08:41.800]  We discussed that AI is nothing new.\n",
      "[08:42.120 --> 08:47.720]  It started in the 1950s and then later in the 1980s,\n",
      "[08:47.900 --> 08:51.600]  AI needed some tools to be developed and these tools were machine learning.\n",
      "[08:52.080 --> 08:58.020]  So machine learning basically was the one that gave the tools to AI to do its job.\n",
      "[08:58.440 --> 09:03.360]  AI was basically created very early by a bunch of\n",
      "[09:03.460 --> 09:10.060]  who wanted to have machines think about, think like humans and work like humans, but then\n",
      "[09:10.060 --> 09:15.580]  they didn't have the tools. So machine learning gave the tools to AI later, and then machine\n",
      "[09:15.580 --> 09:21.300]  learning failed and simple XOR problem, which we probably have discussed already in machine\n",
      "[09:21.300 --> 09:27.740]  learning. The XOR problem was a big deal because this was the first time a new networks were\n",
      "[09:27.740 --> 09:34.020]  kind of abandoned for about 15, 20 years. It's called, it's also known as the big winter for\n",
      "[09:34.020 --> 09:39.880]  neural networks. Why? Because they couldn't solve a big, not only a small nonlinear XOR problem. They\n",
      "[09:39.880 --> 09:49.260]  couldn't divide points that are nonlinear separable. So they had to invent a nonlinear method. In\n",
      "[09:49.260 --> 09:53.500]  other words, the early machine and the early neural networks were actually linearly based.\n",
      "[09:53.500 --> 09:59.040]  and then the deep learning kind of broke that and created the deep learning methods\n",
      "[09:59.040 --> 10:04.120]  which are highly nonlinear. And then artificial intelligence obviously is\n",
      "[10:04.120 --> 10:11.640]  everywhere now deep learning gave the rise to some of the tools that artificial\n",
      "[10:11.640 --> 10:20.920]  intelligence is using and then obviously to do its job. Not everything we call by\n",
      "[10:20.920 --> 10:23.580]  By the way, nowadays it's called artificial intelligence.\n",
      "[10:24.500 --> 10:29.480]  There's a big speculation in the world that people are saying are calling different artificial\n",
      "[10:29.480 --> 10:35.440]  intelligence mechanisms that are nothing more than sophisticated algorithms for analysis\n",
      "[10:36.180 --> 10:39.540]  or in other words, they're not more than machine learning.\n",
      "[10:40.300 --> 10:42.620]  So you got to be careful how we use that.\n",
      "[10:43.460 --> 10:49.500]  In this slide, what we have, we have all these analytics that we discussed before, descriptive\n",
      "[10:49.500 --> 10:56.800]  predictive, predictive, prescriptive, they kind of show you where exactly an AI example\n",
      "[10:56.800 --> 11:03.140]  can be implemented. Obviously, you, anything that substitutes a human intelligence and work\n",
      "[11:03.140 --> 11:08.640]  and time can qualify for an AI use case. In other words, simple machine learning doesn't\n",
      "[11:08.640 --> 11:15.580]  really qualify for an use case, but if machine is taking decision and it's also creating\n",
      "[11:15.580 --> 11:20.060]  in an action based on that decision to substitute the human then obviously you\n",
      "[11:20.060 --> 11:25.020]  can have an AI use case. So again be careful how you use it right machine\n",
      "[11:25.020 --> 11:31.300]  learning itself is not an AI but AI also doesn't necessarily have to imply\n",
      "[11:31.300 --> 11:35.500]  machine learning you may have set of different logic that is not not only\n",
      "[11:35.500 --> 11:40.260]  based on machine learning okay. So this is the descriptive that basically\n",
      "[11:40.260 --> 11:48.320]  actually summarizes what happened to describe the process and why it happened.\n",
      "[11:48.760 --> 11:56.120]  Predictive to serve that a full of future and to see how we can do better in time to\n",
      "[11:56.120 --> 12:00.900]  decrease the cost, let's say, of something to make a better estimate.\n",
      "[12:01.720 --> 12:05.800]  And prescriptive is what we can do in the future.\n",
      "[12:05.800 --> 12:13.320]  As you can see AI encompasses machine learning within itself, although AI is more and larger\n",

      "[12:14.020 --> 12:20.060]  In other words, AI algorithms again don't have to always employ machine learning.\n",
      "[12:20.640 --> 12:25.560]  And deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is given even better tools to AI to work\n",

      "[12:26.580 --> 12:35.780]  Here is another way of looking at this.\n",
      "[12:35.780 --> 12:41.340]  and I worked on a project in Silicon Valley before for UC Berkeley and we created some nice lectures\n",
      "[12:42.260 --> 12:49.280]  along with Amazon and then these slides we actually discussed there and the very pivotal because as\n",
      "[12:49.280 --> 12:56.080]  you can see big data includes it's all about big data is actually machine learning and machine\n",
      "[12:56.080 --> 13:01.980]  learning could be all of these LSTMs generated for adversarial learning. Didi Klay,\n",

      "[13:15.860 --> 13:23.480]  we create a model. This model is then used by a human, right? So how do you make that,\n",
      "[13:23.860 --> 13:28.540]  how do you make that actually more interesting and automatic? Because at this point, this\n",
      "[13:28.540 --> 13:34.220]  is just machine learning. There is no AI in this process. However, to make it AI, then\n",
      "[13:34.220 --> 13:40.820]  we need to build more. Then after the human, human actually analyzes the results, makes\n",
      "[13:40.820 --> 13:46.320]  a decision by the human and then it give it to a specific unit that's called an action.\n",
      "[13:46.820 --> 13:52.800]  And the action unit can also initially start with a human, but later can be given to a\n",
      "[13:52.800 --> 13:58.120]  computer to an electronic device that start making these decisions instead of the human.\n",
      "[13:58.480 --> 14:00.060]  This is called a training process.\n",
      "[14:00.640 --> 14:06.060]  Then the outcome is still supervised as a feedback and a survey by the human.\n",
      "[14:06.520 --> 14:11.740]  And once the loop is closed, the analysis little, but either little is taken over by\n",
      "[14:11.740 --> 14:12.120]  the machine.\n",
      "[14:12.380 --> 14:17.940]  And therefore, these are the first signs that we now have an AI learning loop.\n",
      "[14:17.940 --> 14:25.600]  This is called AI learning loop, where the automation is giving little by little to the\n",
      "[14:25.600 --> 14:31.180]  machine and the machine is now calculating all these formulas that we create and little\n",
      "[14:31.180 --> 14:39.800]  by little the machine is taking over and is making this nice loop that essentially it\n",
      "[14:39.800 --> 14:41.500]  will take a decision on its own.\n",
      "[14:42.060 --> 14:42.620]  That's the reason.\n",
      "[14:42.620 --> 14:47.160]  And then eventually this is what we call perceptual AI.\n",
      "[14:47.420 --> 14:50.140]  Perceptual AI is the human-computer interaction.\n",
      "[14:51.100 --> 14:54.220]  Chatbots work in this way, digital assistant speech\n",
      "[14:54.220 --> 14:56.580]  processing, image recognition, and all that stuff.\n",
      "[14:57.120 --> 14:59.260]  All of these modern techniques are working in this way.\n",
      "[14:59.960 --> 15:03.020]  So this is the AI learning loop, guys.\n",
      "[15:04.020 --> 15:08.880]  Next, we have, so this is the perceptual AI.\n",
      "[15:09.100 --> 15:09.560]  This is the perceptual.\n",
      "[15:09.560 --> 15:16.640]  Next, we have an internet AI where the modern rack systems, they go there, the rack systems,\n",
      "[15:16.860 --> 15:22.500]  so those systems that are scooping the nets and they answer the latest burning questions\n",
      "[15:22.500 --> 15:30.460]  of what you ask them in order for the AI algorithm to not hallucinate.\n",
      "[15:30.720 --> 15:31.460]  What is a hallucination?\n",
      "[15:32.360 --> 15:36.240]  Back before rack systems were part of, let's say, JAD GPT.\n",
      "[15:36.240 --> 15:42.600]  You could ask your GPT anything and the RAC system was not present and therefore you will\n",
      "[15:42.600 --> 15:43.580]  just make up some stuff.\n",
      "[15:43.720 --> 15:49.700]  It will never say I cannot help you because then it's useless and therefore it was hallucinating\n",
      "[15:50.460 --> 15:54.760]  and that was not okay for especially for the sciences, for exact sciences.\n",
      "[15:55.280 --> 15:59.760]  But nowadays if you ask something that is time related then RAC systems will kick in,\n",
      "[16:00.060 --> 16:06.220]  go to the Internet, go to the Internet and it will give you a brief summary of what actually\n",
      "[16:06.220 --> 16:13.240]  Which is good. So internet AI falls there then you have autonomous vehicles self-driving cars\n",
      "[16:13.860 --> 16:18.840]  advanced robotics connected machines drive AI all these are part of it\n",
      "[16:19.800 --> 16:24.680]  And this is the autonomous vehicles autonomous AI and finally we have the business AI\n",
      "[16:24.680 --> 16:29.740]  The business AI is basically where you have fraud detection banks are there\n",
      "[16:30.720 --> 16:35.240]  Cyber security is their machine diagnosis the drug discovery is there as well\n",
      "[16:35.240 --> 16:39.100]  So all the big businesses in different sectors are there.\n",
      "[16:39.880 --> 16:42.060]  And then we have that.\n",
      "[16:42.380 --> 16:49.580]  So this is the full circle of the entire loop of AI learning tools that we apply to different\n",
      "[16:50.960 --> 16:51.840]  major industries.\n",
      "[16:52.900 --> 16:55.640]  Now you might have heard about this, by the way, this is the slides for today.\n",
      "[16:55.840 --> 16:56.960]  I only have three more slides.\n",
      "[16:57.440 --> 16:59.400]  I told you it's going to keep it short and nice.\n",
      "[16:59.400 --> 17:05.000]  and from tomorrow we're gonna start doing all kinds of different new things\n",
      "[17:05.000 --> 17:11.560]  of course and concepts on AI use cases. If you remember there was an Amazon Go\n",
      "[17:11.560 --> 17:15.760]  I'm not sure if you still this business is still around but it's a nice test and\n",
      "[17:15.760 --> 17:20.300]  this Amazon Go was in San Francisco what it was it was basically something\n",
      "[17:20.300 --> 17:25.440]  that you basically go to the store and you just go inside of the store as you\n",
      "[17:25.530 --> 17:31.870]  see to the top left image you pass through some sort of electronic devices where they know who you\n",
      "[17:31.870 --> 17:39.310]  are once you cross that line now you know who you are and your face and your your your ID is\n",
      "[17:39.310 --> 17:45.730]  connected to your credit card so guess what every time you now go and pick anything from the shelves\n",
      "[17:47.410 --> 17:54.070]  automatically person one two three and fours are being tracked by the system and\n",
      "[17:54.610 --> 18:00.190]  then whatever you put in your bag it's automatically charged in your credit\n",
      "[18:00.190 --> 18:07.170]  card so the not yet but until you leave the room the store so the the cameras\n",
      "[18:07.170 --> 18:11.590]  are tracking what you are picking up then you put it in your basket or your\n",
      "[18:11.590 --> 18:15.970]  bag or bag and then you go ahead and you leave the store. At the moment you leave\n",
      "[18:15.970 --> 18:21.070]  the store the system already knows what you took and it builds you at the moment\n",
      "[18:21.070 --> 18:25.990]  you leave the room. So that was Amazon Go. I'm not sure if you have seen this\n",
      "[18:25.990 --> 18:30.190]  that was in San Francisco and I'm not sure if it's still working by the way\n",
      "[18:30.190 --> 18:34.630]  that was a couple years ago. The final slide for today basically shows you the\n",
      "[18:34.630 --> 18:40.610]  adoption of AI challenges. AI has a big problem with trust. A lot of people who\n",
      "[18:40.610 --> 18:42.430]  who don't understand AI and machine learning,\n",
      "[18:43.030 --> 18:45.450]  especially those who are not technically oriented,\n",
      "[18:45.890 --> 18:46.490]  they are scared.\n",
      "[18:46.790 --> 18:48.410]  This is the first thing a human can do.\n",
      "[18:48.710 --> 18:51.830]  If you don't understand something, you get scared.\n",
      "[18:52.290 --> 18:54.490]  And then they start believing all kinds of stories and stuff.\n",
      "[18:54.670 --> 18:56.470]  No, this is not a good way to go.\n",
      "[18:57.110 --> 19:00.230]  And because AI is not gonna go away anytime soon,\n",
      "[19:00.630 --> 19:01.990]  it's gonna be here to stay.\n",
      "[19:02.530 --> 19:04.470]  We need to educate the rest of the people\n",
      "[19:04.470 --> 19:06.290]  who are scared and don't know anything about it.\n",
      "[19:06.770 --> 19:09.210]  That AI is actually not a bad thing to have.\n",
      "[19:10.670 --> 19:12.890]  So what are the industries that can benefit from it?\n",
      "[19:13.090 --> 19:20.130]  Business management, where you can have AI tools to solve problems between build versus buy.\n",
      "[19:20.610 --> 19:26.790]  Build versus buy is a classic problem where depending on the money that you have,\n",
      "[19:27.610 --> 19:31.090]  you can decide if you should spend the money to build something and forever own it,\n",
      "[19:31.270 --> 19:33.870]  or simply buy it or rent it.\n",
      "[19:34.250 --> 19:36.610]  In fact, this is what's happening with our university.\n",
      "[19:36.610 --> 19:41.870]  the building, the new building that we are in, we don't own. We are renting it. It's on our building.\n",
      "[19:42.130 --> 19:46.590]  In other words, this analysis was done and they decided they don't want to hold the real estate.\n",
      "[19:47.050 --> 19:56.070]  They just want to pay rent. That's what is really happening. This is the internally focused digital\n",
      "[19:56.070 --> 20:05.150]  transformation so-called. Next we have data science and governance. That is also connected to AI\n",
      "[20:05.150 --> 20:07.110]  AI adoption and trust and data privacy.\n",
      "[20:07.790 --> 20:10.190]  Next we have human behavior and psychology.\n",
      "[20:10.910 --> 20:15.170]  That is also including AI trust, data privacy and HR.\n",
      "[20:15.790 --> 20:19.270]  And finally we have legal ethics and philosophical issues.\n",
      "[20:19.530 --> 20:22.510]  Legal and ethics are involving data privacy,\n",
      "[20:23.610 --> 20:29.330]  HR privacy and accountability, ethics, legal problems,\n",
      "[20:30.710 --> 20:33.270]  and of course equality and social impact,\n",
      "[20:33.270 --> 20:39.830]  equality in terms of gender's religion and obviously color.\n",
      "[20:40.250 --> 20:46.430]  Then obviously these must be equal and therefore we have to observe what type of data we have.\n",
      "[20:46.550 --> 20:47.690]  Is it bias this data?\n",
      "[20:48.190 --> 20:51.930]  AI augmented economy also falls into this.\n",
      "[20:52.230 --> 20:55.170]  These are externally focused resources.\n",
      "[20:56.290 --> 20:57.030]  All right.\n",
      "[20:57.190 --> 21:01.670]  So this is the first and short talk of the business use cases of AI.\n",
      "[21:01.670 --> 21:05.270]  Let me take attendance here. I think we've done for for today tomorrow\n",
      "[21:05.270 --> 21:11.250]  We have plenty of time to discuss and get into a little more into the weeds of this\n",
      "[21:11.250 --> 21:15.130]  I'm taking attendance right now. So hold on tight here\n",
      "[21:16.550 --> 21:22.490]  Any questions it should be very straightforward at this point. It's very it's just an introductory talk\n",
